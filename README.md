# Engine-Rating-predictions
Python script that predicts the engine rating based on the inspection parameters using only the provided dataset.

# objective 
Your task is to write a small Python that predicts the engine rating based on the inspection parameters using only the
provided dataset. You need to find all the cases/outliers where the rating has been given incorrectly as compared to
current condition of the engine.
This task is designed to test your Python ability, your knowledge of Data Science techniques, your ability to find trends,
outliers, relative importance of variables with deviation in target variable and your ability to work effectively, efficiently
and independently within a commercial setting.
This task is designed as well to test your hyper-tuning abilities or lateral thinking.
